                    <p> Hi! I'm Arunima, a <span>third-year student</span> of Computer Science and Information Technology pursuing Bachelors in Technology. My interest in tech sparked when I joined the <span>Open Source</span> club of our college during my third semester. I felt encouraged to start contributing and saw <span>frontend</span> as an easier way in to the Open Source world. But after I started exploring, I realised that I enjoyed <span>backend development</span> more.</p><br>
                    <p>I made projects using <span>Django</span> and contributed to projects using <span>HTML, CSS, Django, Javascript</span>. I am still exploring various frameworks, technologies and opportunities to grow as a developer.</p><br>
                    <p>Being a big advocate for <span>gender equity</span>, I also led and started a <span>"Women in Tech"</span> chapter in my college that helped girls in tech community feel more welcomed and seen.</p><br>
                    <p>When I am not coding, I love to spend my researching about <span>sociology</span> and <span>gender studies</span>. I find these topics important and very personal as they help me understand how social norms came to be and why these norms exist in the first place. I also love to <span>watch movies</span> and <span>read fiction books</span> as they help me cut off from the world for a little while.</p><br>
                    <p>Currently I am <span>looking for work</span> and excited about collaborating with other devs!</p>
